# Ros basics ðŸ¤–

1. You must [[Setup]] first.

### General tips
 1. The name of the py file can be different from the name of the node which can be diff from the name of the executable.  
2. The location of the node executable is at /ros2_ws/install/my_py_pkg/lib/my_py_pkg
3. It is easier to call the node by ros2 run my_pkg my_node

### Oop tips

its better to use oop in making a node

- make a node class
- put some code in the **init** function in the class
- Init function will run when a class object is created but wont take callbacks
- callbacks will be allowed if the next line is rclpy.spin(node)
- same for c++
- [OOP template](OOP%20template.md)
