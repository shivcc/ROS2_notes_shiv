## Welcome to my notes repository
These notes are part of my personal journey of learning ROS2 and to those who are interested may learn from these as well.

### Start here [ROS2 Basics](ROS2%20Notebook/Ros%20basics.md)
### All notes [ROS2 Notebook](ROS2%20Notebook/)
### ROS2 Mini projects [Mini Projects](ROS2%20Notebook/ROS2%20Mini%20Projects/)

Or you may browse the notes folder. Some notes may not link properly as I mainly use Obsidian as my note-taking app.
